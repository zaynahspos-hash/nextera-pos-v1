## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamchandira/nextera-pos-system
   cd pos
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   
   **Option A: Complete Database Initialization (Recommended)**
   
   Run the complete database setup script in your Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the complete initialization script
   -- Copy and paste the entire content from supabase_complete_init.sql
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Create all required tables with proper structure
   - Set up indexes for optimal performance
   - Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Insert default data (categories, settings, sample discounts)
   - Create necessary functions and triggers
   
   **Option B: Manual Database Setup**
   
   If you prefer manual setup, run these essential commands in your Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   -- Enable required extensions
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";
   
   -- Create core tables (see supabase_complete_init.sql for full schema)
   -- Then add required columns and indexes:
   ALTER TABLE products 
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS track_inventory BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
   
   -- Create performance indexes
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_active ON products(active);
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_category ON products(category);
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_sales_timestamp ON sales(created_at);
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_customers_name ON customers(name);
   ```

5. **Initial Application Setup**
   
   After database setup, configure the application:
   ```bash
   # Start the development server
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Navigate to the application and:
   1. **Create Admin User**: Register the first user
   2. **Configure Store Settings**: Go to Settings → Store Information
   3. **Add Initial Products**: Go to Inventory → Add Product
   4. **Create User Accounts**: Go to User Management to add cashiers/managers

6. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
